# HSR Achievement Scanner UI

Shamelessly adaptated from [kel-z/HSR-Scanner](https://github.com/kel-z/HSR-Scanner/tree/904e2b064ea2005a96d7281f06065488cb33c4ab/src/ui) for ease of use, and because I like his layout.

`form.ui` is made with Qt Creator, and compiled with `compile.bat` to create `form.py`.
